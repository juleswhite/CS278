============

Due Date

Overview
--------

This assignment will require you to use a combination of the software engineering
and software design principles that you have learned in class to build a client/server
application. You must write an application of your choosing that meets the requirements
outlined below. You can choose any application that you would like, however the application
must be a client/server app.

Requirements
------------
1. The application is client/server. Possible options include, but are not limited to: a mobile app that communicates
with a Java Spring back-end over HTTP, an app that builds upon the soda framework used in the
SMS assignment, or a grid computing application that uses the Hazelcast library from Asgn2/3.

2. The application is written in Java.

3. The application has well-written code that has been refactored as needed to be modular and extensible.

4. The application is thoroughly unit tested.

5. The application is integration tested. The integration tests can be written in the language of your choice.

6. The application has a script (e.g., ANT, Maven, Gradle, etc.) to build and package the binaries for 
distribution as a single archive + at most one other file.

7. The application distribution can be installed / launched with a single command.

8. The application has a vagrant project that can be checked out of version control and run in order to
setup your server (http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html).
